### About

This is a Pinterest inspired pinned images gallery for exploring ideas. Not exactly a clone of pinterest, but my
vision of "pinterest" which focuses on a redesign and reimagination of the frontend for a "Pinterest" style web app for sharing ideas. This is a full stack web application using React.js, React ReduxToolkit, Google Firebase (backend), and Tailwind CSS.
